### This software is designed for analysis of solvent flow in molecular dynamics simulations ###

Analysis proceeds in two stages. On the first stage 3D diffusion tensor field is calculated using program tensors and saved in tensors.sit file. Next streamline analysis in spirit of MRI fiber tractography is performed by streamline program. 

###Required input:
Molecular parameters in amber7 format and dcd formatted trajectory .
